# dev-blog-homepage
devblog is a project from my team the DEV-COMMUNITY 

## About Dev-blog 
dev blog is a blog site for developers to share ideas with one another, make new developer friends 
or even create a team just like us. our project has only just a frontend 
meaning it has no functionality i.e it is just a framework 

### why is this repo called dev-blog homepage
i named this repo dev-blog homepage because i took the role of creating 
the homepage part of the project while others took other parts like the login/signup 
and main page 

### biggest take away 
just like @udonna cell im my team would always say 
the best part of programming is fixing bugs and solving problems 
i got lots of tackles during this project but they all led to the completement of the project :partying_face:
